## Azure DevOps:
    ![preview](Azuredevops.md)

 For developing this application we have following teams:
       * Payroll dev team 
       * LeaveMgmt dev team
       * Browser UI team
       * App UI team
       * Duration: 1 year
       * Clients: 
            * coca cola
            * Amul   
## Approach 1 (Big Bang integration):
       * Each team will start devloping the components independently
       * This has 4 teams working independently for 9 months
       * Day 1 of 10th month, Integration of all the work done by independent teams will done by build/release team
       * This approach is called as Big-Bang integration. This mostly fails and to fix the issues we will added lot of technical debt.
  
## Approach 2 (Continuous Integration):
       * Each team will start devloping the components independently This has 4 teams working independently for 9 months

       * Day 1 of first month we start integration.
       * In this approach the team can identify integration issues from day 1. This is called as Continuous Integration 
       * For this to happen, we need tools rather than humans doing the integration. Whenever any team submits code, the integration has to run 
       * Integration includes 
       * building the code 
       * packaging the application 
       * running basic automated tests which will tell health of the application. The cost of fixing issues at different stages

## Agile Ways of Working:
       * There is a need to release the application frequently
       * The need for automating releases increased
       * What we need 
       * Tool for managing continous integrations as well as deployments (releases) to the customer. 
       * A tool where developers can submit the code 
       * A tool for managing the project
       * What we are going to learn Agile (Scrum) Basic Git CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps Minimum Project management Boards Test Managements
